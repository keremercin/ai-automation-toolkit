# Case Study — AI Automation Toolkit

## Problem
Teams receive fragmented events (support tickets, leads, document uploads) but routing decisions are often manual and slow.

## Solution
A webhook-first toolkit that standardizes AI-powered automation outputs:
- support summary + priority,
- lead scoring + segmentation,
- document intake classification.

## Outcome
- easier integration with low-code automation tools,
- consistent JSON outputs for downstream systems,
- clear baseline for production expansions.
