# 90-Second Demo Script

## 0-20s: Problem framing
"Teams lose time when webhook payloads are inconsistent across support, lead, and document intake workflows."

## 20-50s: Product walkthrough
- Open `/docs`
- Show `POST /v1/webhook/support-summary`
- Show `POST /v1/webhook/lead-enrich`
- Show `POST /v1/webhook/document-intake`

## 50-75s: Reliability signal
- Show standardized response envelope (`status/data/meta/error`)
- Show failing payload returning structured `VALIDATION_ERROR`

## 75-90s: Hiring close
"This project demonstrates production-style API contracts, reusable service modules, and test-first workflow automation design."
